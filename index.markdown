# Welcome
It doesn't take long, after hearing about Bitcoin, to hear that you should take your bitcoin off exchanges and into your own custody.

Upto the first few hundred dollars worth, you may be content with a hot wallet such as Muun, Breez or Phoenix, but eventually, we need to think about securing a valuable amount of bitcoin and even about how we hand it down in the case of an untimely death.

This site aims to be a well rounded guide to help newcomers to create their own, super secure, self-custody setups.

As coined by Andreas Antonopoulos, ‚ÄúNot your keys üîë, Not your bitcoin <span style="color: #F7931A; font-weight: bold;">‚Çø</span>‚Äù.

## Case study
After downloading a wallet, we are confronted with a secret set of words that we need to write down and keep safe. 
- If we lose it, we lose our money,
- and if we are not careful, then it will get stolen, 
- **worse still**, we may not realise it for a long time!

If we are storing a small amount, it isn't such a big deal; but over time the value of bitcoin goes up and suddenly we have more bitcoin than we could bare to lose. _This_ is when we start to think harder about security, and possibly even inheritance in case of a tragedy.

This site aims to provide clearly spelled out guides to create a secure, yet convenient wallet with backups and inheritance schemes. Something we can set up and then forget about; for real.

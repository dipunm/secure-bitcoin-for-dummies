Many Bitcoiners have found themselves being targeted due to unforseen rises in price and being unprepared for it. Let's explore what makes you a target and how to avoid it as best as possible.

## What makes you a target

Having lots of valuables isn't the only key to becoming a target; if no one knows about it, then no one would ever think to target you, likewise if people think you are rich when you are not, you are likely to put a target on your own back.

The following things contribute to you becoming a target:
- Appearing to have something valuable to steal
- Appearing to have stored your valuables insecurely
- Appearing to be weak or easy to manipulate

## Don't boast

### Physically

Many Bitcoiners are under a dilemma, they want to promote this amazing technology in the hopes of bringing prosperity to their friends and family, but speaking about the subject in public now, may put you in the spotlight in the future if the value of Bitcoin rises as it has in the past.

If you have not properly considered your risks and security, then you should consider practicing privacy above all else, ensuring that you limit who you mention Bitcoin to and where.

At the very least, avoid disclosing the amount of bitcoin you hold.

### Digitally

It has become practically impossible to stay anonymous online. Apart from the obvious: linking online activity to an IP address and then to a location, we also have common phone numbers and email addresses tying our identities across social media and other platforms that hold enough personal information to pinpoint our physical identity, our home address, and our daily routines.

Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin, was able to stay anonymous, yet in an attempt to identify them, a lot was learned about Satoshi, using hints from the dialect of english that they wrote in, to the times that they were active on forums.

Be careful when interacting online and what you reveal, you are not untouchable online.

## Don't give away your security

### Physically

Once you have protected your bitcoin, you may want to educate your friends and family to do the same. Giving details on how you have done so may be advantageous to them, as they can often get a shortcut to understanding what you have understood. It might be obvious, but if you are not careful, you may give away important details that compromise your own security.

Consider that you have the typical 24 words and a passphrase setup. You may give away examples of where you might keep your 24 words, while keeping the passphrase private. Even if you don't give away exactly where you keep your backups, you have likely given enough clues to have compromised it.

The 24 words plus passphrase setup is often asymmetric in terms of security. A 24 word seed phrase has an entropy of 256 bits and the passphrase itself is often as secure as a typical password which may have only double digits of entropy, and is often riddled with patterns and biases that make it easier to guess.

If your 24 words are compromised, then your bitcoin is effectively secured by your passphrase only. You may trust your friends and family to not attempt to steal from you, but we often find information leaks over time and the information may end up in the wrong hands eventually.

### Digitally

The internet is an echo chamber; information tends to duplicate and spread across the internet, especially if you don't want it to.

Things like private keys and passwords are easy to recognise and are often accompanied by metadata such as where the information was sourced from. When discovered, this type of information gives attackers the confidence to target you or your protected accounts and assets.

The simplest rule to follow will go a long way: avoid putting private keys or passphrases on a computer or storage device as much as you can.

## Don't leave things lying about

### Physically

Just like giving away hints about your security may convince someone that they could steal from you with little risk to themselves, so will leaving valuable things around for people to see.

For example, don't leave jewellery or car keys near the front door.

In terms of Bitcoin security, don't leave your seed plates around and don't leave your phone unlocked and unattended.

### Digitally

The nature of digital things means that we aren't talking about "leaving" things lying about, because digital things leave traces of itself where ever it goes.

We should not put valuable information anywhere insecure and the moment we learn that something could become insecure, we should take that seriously.

We should not load this information onto public computers or devices that are not our own. We should not leave it on cloud storage accounts where access to said information requires only permission which is provided by a third party. Even if you trust the cloud company to not read your content, if your password is weak, you have effectively left the door open for anyone.

## Don't create a honeypot

### Physically

If you have a big safe or a jewellery box, that's a honey pot. A single thing to steal or break that will provide a quick and meaningful payout. Even if a single vault is difficult to open, the fact that it contains so much within it would mean it was worth the time to break into it.

### Digitally

Bitcoin itself is digital, and all records of where every satoshi of a bitcoin exists is recorded on that blockchain publicly. Regardless of whether the blockchain itself is pseudonomous or not, depositing multiple times to a single address will broadcast two things:

1. There is a lot of loot in a single place protected by a single private key
2. You likely don't understand great privacy practices so your identity is worth looking for, it's probably not that hard to find

Be sure to use wallets that avoid re-using addresses, and take the time to learn ways to preserve or enhance your privacy on bitcoin. It is not a small subject, but a little will go a long way towards avoiding becoming a target.

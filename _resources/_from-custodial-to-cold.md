# From custodial to cold

{:.note}
There are many ways to store and control bitcoin, we will explore some of the different wallet types and their pros and cons.

## Custodial wallet

The most common type of custodial wallet is one provided by an exchange, or service provider.

### Pros

Custodial wallets give you quick access to the features that the custodian provides. For example, an exchange will show you a bitcoin and a dollar balance, and will allow you to convert units of one balance to the other based on an exchange rate and considering administrative fees.

Some custodial wallets will add interest, or yield to your balance as a reward for lending them your bitcoin.

Custodial wallets are often guarded by familiar forms of security: things like passwords, email and sms confirmations, and 2 factor authentication. They also often require your personal information that may be useful in certain situations such as if you lose the ability to log in, or if you pass away.

### Cons

A custodial wallet is the most dangerous type of wallet. You are relying on legal ownership which is limited to the incentives and support of the law and law enforcement. A custodian has full control of the assets you have a **legal claim** to.

All custodians work the same way, including traditional banks; you will hand your assets to the custodian, they will credit your account by updating a private database, and the custodian has a legal debt to you, payable in whatever ways are mentioned in the terms and conditions.

If due to malice, incompetence or negligence, the custodian refuses or is unable to process your request to withdraw or convert your bitcoin, the extent to which you will be compensated and the custodian will be penalised is up to the legal system.

We tend not to think of the worst case because we expect companies to do right by us in order to protect their reputations. Unfortunately, companies are not infallable:

- They can be compelled to take certain actions that are not in yours, or their best interest,
- They can be subject to cyber attacks that leave them in an impossible situation,
- They can file for bankruptsy and not have enough money to compensate their customers.

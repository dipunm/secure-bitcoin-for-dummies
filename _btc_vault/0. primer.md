# A visual primer to bitcoin vaults

{: .note}
This page aims to give you a feeling for what a comprehensive bitcoin vault might look like with the aid of a diagram. 

The following diagram illustrates access points that we might design for our bitcoin vault. This diagram makes use of the ColdCard, XOR Seeds, and BlueWallet's "Watch-Only wallet". Your final setup may differ and use alternative tools with different features.

Our visual guide consists of 4 parts:

1. A spend wallet
2. A recovery plan
3. A watch and deposit wallet
4. An inheritance plan

When creating our vault, we would follow the above order. However the colours indicate how frequently each part might be used:

- The watch and deposit wallet, marked in *green*{:.text-green-300}, will be our most frequently used part.
- We expect that our spend wallet, marked in *orange*{:.text-yellow-300}, will be used less frequently.
- Our recovery plan, marked in *red*{:.text-red-300}, should not typically be required, it exists purely in case of an emergency.
- Finally, the inheriance plan is not expected to be used until the most final of emergencies.

# The spend wallet

The spend wallet allows us to create and sign transactions from set of bitcoin addresses. Bitcoin addresses can be thought of as one-time use banking account details that we often present to others as a QR code.

In this diagram, we use the ColdCard hardware wallet which has a comprehensive set of security features to protect our keys. Hardware wallets allow us to safely spend our bitcoin without making common mistakes that might leak our private key(s) to the world wide web.

The ability to spend is protected by two factors here: 
- we require physical access to the device, 
- we require knowledge of the access pin(s).

# The recovery plan

{:.note}
A recovery plan should be considered a one time use tool. If we ever need to use it, our vault is probably compromised and we should use it to move funds to a new vault as soon as we can.

As part of setting up our hardware wallet, we will have a 24 word mnemonic phrase written down which we are expected to hide and protect. This is the most basic form of a recovery plan, but it can also be easy to lose, steal or destroy.

Our recovery plan uses a technique called "Seed XOR" to split our backup into two keys, and store them separately. We will carefully store one key digitally online, and the other on a physical medium.

This setup protects our bitcoin from theft:
- If our digital key is compromised, hackers will not be able to access our bitcoin without the physical counterpart.
- If physical key is stolen, an robber is unlikely to have access to the digital counterpart.

It also protects our bitcoin from lossses:

- If stored on a reputable cloud storage such as Dropbox, Google Drive or similar, our digital key will automatically be duplicated which protects it from accidental loss and our cloud account can typically be restored even if we forget our account password.
- Our physical key can be duplicated to ensure that we have backup copies if our key is ever lost or stolen, and the requirement of needing the digital counterpart means that creating duplicates will not directly compromise our bitcoin in the way that the basic recovery solution might.

Finally, we include a document with detailed instructions that should ease our minds and allow us to calmly and safely recover our bitcoin.

To recover, we need access to one of the physical keys, and one of the digital keys. We can then either use a new ColdCard or a paper worksheet to combine them for full access to our funds.

# The watch and deposit wallet

This part of the setup allows us to view our balance and to deposit funds into our vault without even touching our hardware wallet. This gives us a more convenient way to interact with our bitcoin vault which will help us resist the persuasive urge to compromise our security for convenience.

We use a special key called the XPUB key which we provide to our watch-only wallet. This key is used to reveal the public addresses that our hardware wallet is able to spend from. A mobile wallet will use this to sum and display our total balance, and to reveal more unused addresses which we can deposit bitcoin to.

{:.note}
Our XPUB key cannot control our bitcoin, and it cannot be used to reverse engineer our private key(s). This is why we are able to use it on a personal mobile device without compromising the security of our bitcoin.

# The inheritance plan
![The inheritance plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/VAULT-inheritance.drawio.png)

The final part is the inheritance plan. In our example, we have a physical key that is typically covered, sealed and then given to a trusted lawyer for safe keeping. The second key is given directly to the inheritors, typically by email along with clear instructions on how to get access and sweep the funds. It should also include links to resources that can be used to educate and/or provide services safely to prevent inheritors from losing money to scams and predatory businesses.

If set up correctly, our lawyer will act as a trigger to provide the missing peices at the right time such that the funds cannot be controlled by anyone but ourselves while we are alive, and only our inheritor(s) will be able to use the funds after our death. We will explore other triggers such as online services and weigh the benefits against the risks and costs.

{:.note}
The recovery plan and the inheritance plan MUST NOT rely on the same keys. Keeping our keys unique between access points ensures that one access plan cannot compromise another. This guide will walk us through creating unique sets of keys safely and correctly.

# A visual primer to bitcoin vaults

We use the term "**bitcoin vault**", or "**vault**", to describe a bitcoin wallet that can only be spent via **access points**.\
\
An **access point** provides a way to view and sign transactions using two or more **secrets** that reveal the wallet's master key when combined. Access points allow us to keep our **secrets** separate allowing for a much more robust security model.

The following diagram illustrates access points that we might design for our bitcoin vault.

This diagram makes use of the ColdCard, XOR Seeds, and BlueWallet's "Watch-Only wallet". Your final setup may differ and use alternative tools with different features.

Our theoretical setup has 4 access points:

1. A watch and deposit wallet <sup>1</sup>
2. A spend wallet
3. A recovery plan 
4. An inheritance plan

<sup>1</sup> The watch and deposit wallet is read-only; this means that it cannot be used to control our bitcoin, only to observe and track it.

Don't worry if the diagram above seems overwhelming, the following sections will break down each access point to give you an idea of what they are, and how and why they work.

# The watch and deposit wallet
![The watch wallet]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/VAULT-watch.drawio.png)

This access point of the setup allows us to view our balance and to deposit funds into our vault only. It gives us a convenient way to interact with our bitcoin vault, which will help us resist the urge to compromise our security for convenience by reaching for our hardware wallet which is now to be used exclusively for spending.

We use a special "XPUB" key which we provide to our watch-only wallet during setup. This key can only be used to reveal the public addresses that our hardware wallet is able to spend from; a mobile wallet will use this to sum and display our total balance, and to reveal more unused addresses which we can deposit bitcoin to. Bitcoin addresses can be thought of as one-time use banking account details that we often present to others as a QR code.

This setup is not as secure as the others. The XPUB is encrypted on our mobile device when locked and protected by a pin that we keep secret (hopefully), and the mobile device is kept within our own proximity at most times, however our mobile device is connected to the internet. This makes it potentially vulnerable to remote attacks, viruses and malware.

{:.note}
Our XPUB key cannot control our bitcoin, and it cannot be used to reverse engineer our private key(s). This is why we are able to use it on a personal mobile device, allowing for convenience over security. There are ways to increase the security of this setup too which may or may not be appropriate for us.

# The spend wallet

The spend wallet allows us to create and sign transactions from set of bitcoin addresses. We can safely use this with our watch-only wallet since the hardware wallet will never expose its secret to the mobile device or the world wide web.

The security model of this access point does rely on a relatively safe home, however the ColdCard provides quite a few security features such as its self destruction after 13 bad pin attempts, or a "brick me pin" that can be left nearby the device as a trap. This can be useful to foil the attempts by a house robber or even a thieving friend or family.

The ability to spend is protected by following main factors: 
- we require physical access to the device 
- the device is stored safely within a secure home
- we require knowledge of the access pin(s)
- the device is designed to be very difficult to break
- the device holds its secret encrypted on chip

# The recovery plan

{:.note}
A recovery plan should be considered a one time use tool. If we ever need to use it, our vault is probably compromised and we should use it to move funds to a new vault as soon as we can.

As part of setting up our hardware wallet, we will have a 24 word mnemonic phrase written down which we are expected to hide and protect. This is the most basic form of a recovery plan, but it can also be easy to lose, steal or destroy.

Our recovery plan uses a technique called "Seed XOR" to split our backup into two keys, and store them separately. We will carefully store one key digitally online, and the other on a physical medium.

This setup protects our bitcoin from theft:
- If our digital key is compromised, hackers will not be able to access our bitcoin without the physical counterpart.
- If physical key is stolen, an robber is unlikely to have access to the digital counterpart.

It also protects our bitcoin from lossses:

- If stored on a reputable cloud storage such as Dropbox, Google Drive or similar, our digital key will automatically be duplicated which protects it from accidental loss and our cloud account can typically be restored even if we forget our account password.
- Our physical key can be duplicated to ensure that we have backup copies if our key is ever lost or stolen, and the requirement of needing the digital counterpart means that creating duplicates will not directly compromise our bitcoin in the way that the basic recovery solution might.

Finally, we include a document with detailed instructions that should ease our minds and allow us to calmly and safely recover our bitcoin.

To recover, we need access to one of the physical keys, and one of the digital keys. We can then either use a new ColdCard or a paper worksheet to combine them for full access to our funds.

# The inheritance plan

The final access point is the inheritance plan. In our example, we have a physical key that is typically covered, sealed and then given to a trusted lawyer for safe keeping. The second key is given directly to the inheritors, typically by email along with clear instructions on how to get access and sweep the funds. It should also include links to resources that can be used to educate and/or provide services safely to prevent inheritors from losing money to scams and predatory businesses.

If set up correctly, our lawyer will act as a trigger to provide the missing peices at the right time such that the funds cannot be controlled by anyone but ourselves while we are alive, and only our inheritor(s) will be able to use the funds after our death. We will explore other triggers such as online services and weigh the benefits against the risks and costs.

{:.note}
The recovery plan and the inheritance plan MUST NOT rely on the same keys. Keeping our keys unique between access points ensures that one access plan cannot compromise another. This guide will walk us through creating unique sets of keys safely and correctly.

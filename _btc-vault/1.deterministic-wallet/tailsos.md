## You will need
- A laptop or desktop computer (see [supported specs](https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/requirements/index.en.html))
- An 8GB+ usb storage drive
- One or more 6 sided dice
- Scrap paper and pen

The scrap paper will be used to store sensitive information as we set up our vault. Be sure to handle with care, and **do not use a digital device**. We will need to destroy the information leaving no trace once we are complete to properly secure our vault.

## Reference material

TailsOS is an OpenSource OS that runs directly from a USB stick and tries to leave no traces of your activity when you shutdown. Each time you log into TailsOS will be like a fresh installation.

- TailsOS

The two main reasons for using TailsOS is to either avoid the cost of the ColdCard, or to avoid using Bitcoin specific hardware. This guide will require some calculations to be made on paper using a lookup table. It will be useful to print or write down the following materials:

- Seed words mapped to hexadecimal numbers
- Seed XOR Lookup table
